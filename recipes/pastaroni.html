        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Whether you label it as a nostalgic childhood yearning, a gourmet creation in a dorm room, or merely a pantry essential from the grocery store, crafting homemade angel hair pasta with herbs is equally delicious and quick! The straightforwardness of the process is undeniable.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Chicken Broth</li>
            <li>3 Ounces Angel Hair Pasta</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Butter</li>
            <li>1 Clove Garlic, Minced</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon Italian Seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>3/4 Cup Finely Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Minced Fresh Parsley, or to Taste</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring chicken broth in a saucepan to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling broth, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta, reserving 1/4 cup of chicken broth.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in Italian seasoning, reserved 1/4 cup chicken broth, and whipping cream. Add Parmesan cheese and stir until melted.</li>
            <li>Stir in angel hair pasta; toss to coat. Garnish with freshly minced parsley.</li>
